heart	O
of	O
the	O
backpacker	O

only	O
problem	O
was	O
the	O
noise	B-NEG

This	O

is	O
not	O
a	O
5-star	O
in	O
the	O
'traditional'	O

the	O
reality	O

ran	O
out	O
of	O
things	O

Overall	O
I	O
would	O
highly	O
recommend	O
staying	O
at	O
this	O
hotel	O
and	O
if	O
I	O

The	O
breakfast	B-POS
was	O
good	O
!	O

The	O
only	O
fault	O
I	O
can	O
comment	O
on	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
are	O
returning	O
to	O
the	O
hotel	O
via	O
taxi	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
always	O
know	O
where	O
the	O
hotel	O
is	O
or	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
you	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
distance	O

for	O
three	O
nights	O

,	O
,	O
the	O
location	B-NEG
is	O
hard	O
to	O

down	O
an	O
alley	O

Your	O
proactive	O
housekeeping	O
with	O
turndown	O
service	B-NEG
every	O
night	O
also	O
sets	O
you	O
apart	O
from	O
other	O
5	O

hotels	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
a	O
